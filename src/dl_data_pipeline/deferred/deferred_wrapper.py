    """
    Context manager to temporarily disable deferred execution and execute functions immediately.

    This context manager allows the user to execute functions immediately even when they
    are decorated with `@deferred_function`, bypassing the default deferred execution mode.

    Upon entering the context (`with instant_execution():`), deferred execution is disabled.
    Once the block is exited, deferred execution is restored to its previous state, even if
    an exception occurs within the block.

    Example usage:
        @deferred_function
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b

        # Deferred execution mode (default)
        result_node = add(PipelineNode(), 5)

        # Instant execution mode (within context)
        with instant_execution():
            result = add(3, 5)
            # Executes immediately and returns 8

    Note:
        - This context manager ensures that deferred execution is always restored after the
          `with` block, even if an exception is raised.

    Raises:
        Any exceptions raised during the execution of the code inside the `with` block will be
        propagated, but deferred execution will be restored regardless of exceptions.
